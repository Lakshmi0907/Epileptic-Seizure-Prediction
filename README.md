# Epileptic-Seizure-Detection
Detection of Epileptic Seizures using Deep Learning Algorithms

Data set link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Epileptic+Seizure+Recognition

We have used 2 Deep Learning Algorithms that is CNN and LSTM.
1) Initially we have preprocessed the dataset.
2) Then data was split into training and testing in the ratio of 70 and 30
3) 10 fold cross validation was applied.

Accuracies obtained are :

1) CNN 70-30 split : 98.72 %
2) CNN 10 fold cross validation : 99.32 %
3) LSTM 70-30 split : 97%
4) LSTM 10 fold cross validation : 97%
